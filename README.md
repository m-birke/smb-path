## About

Many tools make use of `pathlib.Path` internally. This is a problem if the files are located on a fileshare. `smb-path` provides wrapper of `Path` which acts accordingly but using the SMB protocol for file operations instead of the local hosts file system. Atm. `smb-path` focuses on pure reading of the data. The SMB protocol implementation of [smbprotocol](https://pypi.org/project/smbprotocol/) is used.

All the utility functions of `Path` should work for `SmbPath` as well (like the `/` operator, `with_suffix`, `parents`, etc.).

Currently the following SMB dependent functions are implemented:

- `glob` (experimental)
- `iterdir`
- `mkdir`
  - **NOTE:** param `mode` has currently no effect, it falls back to `755` !
- `open`
  - and hence dependent funtions like `read_bytes`, etc.
- `stat`
  - and hence dependent functions like `lstat`, `is_file`, `is_dir`, `exists`, etc.
- `rename`
- `replace`
- `rmdir`
- `symlink_to`
- `unlink`

Missing operations (throwing exception) with current version (and questionable whether all of them will come) are:

- `chmod`
- `hardlink_to`
- `resolve`
  - Resolves symlinks and makes relative paths absolute, latter is useless for SmbPath
- `touch`

## Installation

```console
pip install smb-path
```

## Usage

`smb-path` just needs to be installed. After the installation, you just use `Path()` to instantiate a `SmbPath`. It is checked whether the provided path string applies to the regex pattern `r"(//|\\\\)([a-z0-9_-]+)((\.[a-z0-9_-]+)*)(\.[a-z]+){1}"`.

The path string

- must start with `//` or `\\`
- must continue with a server name, `a-z`, `0-9` and `_`, `-` allowed, eg. `filshr33`
- optionally an arbitrary number of periods separated by a `.`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`, `-` allowed, eg. `.us.dieterscompany`
- must continue with an url closing with `.` then a-z, eg. `.com`
- can contain trailing fileshare names, directories or files, eg. `/myShare/myDir/myFile.txt`

Hence `//filshr33.us.dieterscompany.com/myShare/myDir/myFile.txt` would be a valid SMB path.

**If the pattern does not match, a `Path` object like you are used to it is returned** (`WindowsPath` or `PosixPath`).

### SMB Configuration

Use `smbclient.ClientConfig` to configure the SMB connection. Eg. `smbclient.ClientConfig(username="itsme", password="myPW")`. Refer to [smbprotocol](https://pypi.org/project/smbprotocol/) for further information.

## Compatibility

`smbprotocol` is platform agnostic since it does not care about the path separator.

Tested with installation into a `python -m venv` virtual environment.
